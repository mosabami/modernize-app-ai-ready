# Task 12 - Create a postgresql user and set up an AI Hub and Prompt Flow

<!--- Estimated time: 20 minutes---> 

## Introduction

Azure AI Studio Hub is a central resource that helps teams manage, collaborate, and organize their AI projects.

## Description

In this task, youâ€™ll create a hub and then create a project within the hub. Youâ€™ll also create a PostgreSQL user so that the flow can access the database records.

## Solution

1. Return to Visual Studio Code. Enter the following command at the Terminal window prompt. This command creates a unique name for an AI Hub.

    ```
    $AI_HUB_NAME="ai-hub$(Get-Random -Minimum 100000 -Maximum 999999)"
    Write-Host -ForegroundColor Green  "AI Hub name is: " $AI_HUB_NAME

    ```
