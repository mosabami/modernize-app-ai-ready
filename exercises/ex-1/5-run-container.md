# Task 05 -  Run the containerized app and add a booking

## Introduction

You created a Docker container and pushed the container to ACR in previous tasks. Now, you‚Äôll run the container and view the app in a browser. Since this is the first time you are running the app, you‚Äôll need to run a process to create the database schema and populate the tables with data.

Now, you can view the various pages for the app and try out the features.
 

## Description

In this task, you‚Äôll run the Docker app container and then display the setup page for the app. You‚Äôll create the database schema and populate the tables with data. You‚Äôll review common app pages and add a booking record. Finally, you‚Äôll search for the record you just added to verify that the record was successfully added to the database.

## Solution

1. Assuming you successfully created your environment variable for `connectionString` in the previous step, enter the command at the Visual Studio Code Terminal window prompt and then select **Enter**. This command starts the containerized app.
    > :warning: Ensure your Docker Desktop is running before running the command below. If Docker desktop says Docker is stopped, you can close the program and reopen it.

    ```
